    <h1>Importance of <span class=“bold”>Extracurricular Activities</span> in Students’ Lives</h1>
</div>
    <div class=“content”>
    <p>If you are a six-year-old kid who wants to learn the basics of Karate or a sixty-year-old individual who wants to acquire knowledge of yoga and meditation, 
        at every age learning is a part of our daily life. It has no age bars and it defines the inner passion that is needed to be followed. 
        Non-Academic Learning plays an equal part in an individual’s life. Be it trying your hands on fitness and training, mastering the skills of check-mate moves, 
        or pursuing your passion of becoming a musician or a dancer, every extra-curricular activity has its own advantages and it plays an important role in students’ day-to-day lives.
    </p>
<h2>WHAT ARE EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES?</h2>
    <p><span class=“bold”>Extra-Curricular Activities</span> are a part of the education system where students indulge themselves in another way of learning outside their textbooks. They contribute to boosting one’s self-confidence and overall personal development. It is not necessary that it only includes your hobbies. Singing a song or playing a video game occasionally are not listed under non-academic learning. But, if anything that leads to enhancing your skills and building your mind muscles, then they are known as Extracurricular Activities.</p>
</div>
    <div class=“footer”>
    <p>Non-Academic subjects hold great interest as they impress interviewees in your future interviews. They help you explore the deeper insights outside your textbooks. One can go after their hobbies and engage in a fun learning process through extra-curricular activities.</p>
    <p>HomeGuru is one of the finest learning platforms that provide home tuitions and online classes for both academic and non-academic courses. If you want to pursue your passion as your full-time career or looking for creative learning after school, then HomeGuru fulfills all your subject needs.</p>
